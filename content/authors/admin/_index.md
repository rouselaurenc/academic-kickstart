Lauren Rouse (they/she) is a third year doctoral candidate at the University of Central Florida. Their dissertation research focuses on canonical representations of PTSD in Netflix television show fandoms--focusing on embodiment, social construction of stereotypes, and the disabling of able-bodied characters in fan fiction. They have been published in Social Media + Society, Transformative Works and Cultures, and have a forthcoming book chapter, out in Summer 2022. They are the current Outreach Coordinator for the Young Democratic Socialists of America chapter at UCF and the president of the Texts and Technology Student Organization. They enjoy thrifting, tending to their ~80 house plants, playing with their cat, Bones of the Master, and are probably drinking coffee right now.
